:zzz: Enough about me lets dive into this repository to gather some understanding . 

This is a  work in progress  Spring Secuirty  architecture that could be followed to learn SpringBoot Security for Rest Api's at one place .
There is ongoing work to add  a lot of other capabilities and modules needed to create a real world application like system.


Please discard indentation and formatting  of this readme file as it's not as per the standard what we generally have . 
This readme is intended  for my personal use as  quick refer doc for any module .
Once all the modules are covered then it would be updated accordingly 

Below-mentioned modules are used to create these microservices .

1. Spring Security
2. Spring Boot Starter Web
3. Spring Boot Starter Oauth
4. Spring Cloud Dev Tools
5. Spring Boot Data Jpa
6. Spring Boot JDBC
7. Spring Boot Starter Test
8. Spring Security Test
9. H2 database

Core Concepts you would learn from here are listed below 
1. SpringSecurityFilter Chain(WebSecurity Adaptor is depreciated with Spring Security 6)
2. Using in memory H2 Database
3. Basic user -password authentication - By UserDetailsService
4. Jwt based user authentication - By Oauth
5. JWT  validation (Integrity & Expiry) - By Oauth(JwtEncoder , JwtDecoder)

This application would start on  port 8087
use below curl to get your token
